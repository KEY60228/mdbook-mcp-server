# Introduction

**Alice's Adventures in Wonderland** (commonly shortened to *Alice in Wonderland*) is an 1865 novel written by English author Lewis Carroll (the pseudonym of Charles Dodgson). It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures.

The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course, structure, characters, and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.
